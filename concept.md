We separate this logically and technically where possible to avoid damage to important stuff. Here are some timeless statements to make this happen and general guidelines to protect resources

## General
- banane@alleaffengaffen.chÂ is the mail address used for accounts and contacts
- dedicated orgs or accounts have to be used
- exception to above is GH which is used for code and as IDP 
- dedicated DNS alleaffengaffen.ch
- dedicated credit card (Visa) 
- Automation where possible or effective, but not everywhere (we want to understand things before automating them)
- if possible use the alleaffengaffen org on github or infomaniak to do things if there are no specific reasons for another provider
- relies on my private DR to keep access to important accounts and data
- Github as IDP is preferred over dediacted accounts
- track things in issues directly in the coresponding repository

## Data
- S3 for all backups where backup is needed (configs shall be stored in git or docs)
- use automatic nuking to keep costs low (based on tags if possible)
- uses akeyless.io for sensitive data (e.g secrets for terraform, kubernetes, github) 

## Networking
- tailnet alleaffengaffen should be use for networking
- uses the public network with appropriate zero-trust security, hidding behind a FW is a no-go.
