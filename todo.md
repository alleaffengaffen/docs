## Ideas

1. Update local dev environments to be consistent / reproducable
2.  Cluster-API management cluster using kind moved to openstack
3. Postgresql Operator (Crunchydata or Zalando)
4. Production-ready K3s Cluster on tailscale (for services that are better self-hosted)
5. Create a custom GitPod (or Codespaces) dotfiles/container/template to quickly develop new things on Argo CD
6. Try Crossplane to provision EKS clusters
7. Install cluster using kubespray (and maybe Terraform + ansible provider inventory)
8. Figure out if kOps should be used and with which platform (e.g add CI)
9. Try Paralus for kubectl access
10. Try Flatcar Linux (and get to know it)
11. Linux from Scratch
12. Kubernetes IPv6 (e.g use the /64 net of each host to create a truly public IPv6 cluster)

## In Progress

- Weddingphone (got all the necessary hardware, not it's time to fully put it together

## Notes

This bucketlist doesn't contain anything you need to do, this is just things you could do. There is a reserved window every second Friday to hack something.

Note: if there are specific issues on a project track them as issues in the repo or inline in markdown. This is just a collection of things I really want to try.

Project status shall be tracked in separate Notes if any.
