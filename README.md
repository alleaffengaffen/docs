## Bucketlist

- Cluster-API management cluster using kind moved to openstack
- Postgresql Operator (Crunchydata or Zalando)
- Production-ready K3s Cluster on tailscale (for services that are better self-hosted)
- Create a custom GitPod (or Codespaces) dotfiles/container/template to quickly develop new things on Argo CD
- Try Crossplane to provision EKS clusters
- Install cluster using kubespray (and maybe Terraform + ansible provider inventory)
- Figure out if kOps should be used and with which platform (e.g add CI)
- Try Paralus for kubectl access
-. Try Flatcar Linux (and get to know it)
- Linux from Scratch
- Kubernetes IPv6 (e.g use the /64 net of each host to create a truly public IPv6 cluster)
